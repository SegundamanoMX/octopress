Segundamano.mx is organazing its very own Hackathon: Hackamano 2015.
The event will take place at the ITAM University campus in Mexico City
the 20 & 21 June 2015.

The idea is that anyone can participate and be part of a team, with
a very ambitious goal in mind: develop solution to today's problems in
local communities.

This can span from improving access to education, water supply, waste
management, public transportation or whatever you think it makes sense
in your social context.

This will be the only rule, everything else will be limited by your own
imagination!

To get more information about the event, please refer to the [official page](http://hackamano.segundamano.mx). The registration page is also up and running [here](http://bit.ly/hackamano-registro). Places are limited, go register now!
