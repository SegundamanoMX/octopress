Segundamano.mx is now on GitHub. Follow our [Organization Page](https://github.com/SegundamanoMX).

The first repository that we have publised is this blog itself, whose source code
will be available at [this location](https://github.com/SegundamanoMX/octopress)
and we hope that with time we'll be able to publish more bits and pieces, including contributions
to third party FLOSS, our own software, and some challenges that we'll tackle together with some
local communities.

Stay tuned, and feel free to fork and contribute back on any of our public repositories!
